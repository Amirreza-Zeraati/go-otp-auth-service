## üõ¢ Database Choice Justification

### Postgres

* Reliable, scalable, and widely used for structured relational data.
* Perfect for managing user accounts and authentication records.
* Strong support for indexing and queries.

### Redis

* Used for OTP storage and rate limiting.
* Super fast in-memory store with TTL (time-to-live) support.
* Prevents abuse by controlling OTP request frequency.

Together, Postgres handles persistent user data while Redis manages ephemeral OTPs and rate limits.
